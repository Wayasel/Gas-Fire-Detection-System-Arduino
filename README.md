# Gas-Fire-Detection-System-Arduino
Gas and Fire Detection System is an Arduino-based safety project that detects gas leaks and fire in real time. Using gas and flame sensors, it monitors the environment and activates a buzzer during danger. A relay module can control external devices, and live data is shown on the Serial Monitor.
